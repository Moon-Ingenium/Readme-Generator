#Readme-Generator

*   The first step was requiring the depedencies
*   Began by generating questions to prompt the user
*   After that, I created a function using string templates to dynamically generate a markdown file
*   Exported thr function
*   Then I used that function to write a file 
*   I chose three common licenses and dynamically displayed the choice to the page
*   Created a table of contents that when clicked will move to that section of the readme
*   Created links to contact the user
